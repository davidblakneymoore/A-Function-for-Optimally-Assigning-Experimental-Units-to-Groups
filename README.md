# A Function for Optimally Assigning Experimental Units to Groups in R

This function was split up into two functions, `Optimally_Assigning_Experimental_Units_to_Treatment_Groups_With_Blocking_Variables` and `Optimally_Assigning_Experimental_Units_to_Treatment_Groups_With_No_Blocking_Variables`, and these functions now live in the `DBM.functions` package that can be found here.
